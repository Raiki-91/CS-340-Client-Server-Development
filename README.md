### Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Programs 
To ensure maintainability, readability, and adaptability, I structured the code into modules with clear separation of concerns and used descriptive naming conventions. Comprehensive documentation, including docstrings and comments, was provided to aid understanding. Robust error handling and unit tests were implemented for reliability. These practices resulted in a reusable and scalable CRUD module that can be integrated into various projects, reducing development time and enhancing maintainability.

### Approach to Problem-Solving as a Computer Scientist
When tackling the requirements for these projects I analyzed the objectives and designed the system architecture, focusing on modularity and scalability. The CRUD operations were developed first, followed by the dashboard using the Dash framework, ensuring incremental development and thorough testing. This approach differed from previous assignments by integrating multiple components and emphasizing user interface design. Future projects will benefit from this structured approach, focusing on scalability, normalization, indexing, security, and backup plans.

### Role of Computer Scientists and Project Impact
Computer scientists design and optimize software systems to solve complex problems, creating efficient and secure systems that handle large-scale data. Their work drives technological innovation and operational efficiency across various domains. The interactive dashboard we created helps similary by improving decision-making and operational efficiency by providing real-time insights and automating data management tasks, which theoretically would enable the organization to save more animals and enhance their welfare.
